            <h3>Author: Karen M.Mcmanus</h3>

                One day after school, five students at Bayview High, Bronwyn, Addy, Cooper, Nate, and Simon, walk into detention. However, Simon never makes it out of that classroom because before the end of detention, Simon dies from an allergic reaction and according to investigators, his death was not an accident. On Monday he died, but on Tuesday he had planned to post juicy reveals about all four of the students from detention, which makes all four of them suspects in his murder. Throughout the book, the group tries to clear their names and figure out who really caused Simon’s death, all while dealing with their own personal drama. Who committed the crime? Is it one or all of them? Is it someone from the outside?

                Bronwyn, the brain, is Yale-bound and never breaks a rule. Addy, the beauty, is the picture-perfect homecoming princess. Nate, the criminal, is already on probation for dealing. Cooper, the athlete, is the all-star baseball pitcher. And Simon, the outcast, is the creator of Bayview High’s notorious gossip app.
